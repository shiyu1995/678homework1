## Multinomial logit: 
Using the individual-level survey data from the 2000 National Election Study (data in folder nes), predict party identification (which is on a 7-point scale) using ideology and demographics with an ordered multinomial logit model.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nes5200<-read.dta("http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/nes/nes5200_processed_voters_realideo.dta")
#saveRDS(nes5200,"nes5200.rds")
#nes5200<-readRDS("nes5200.rds")
# logistic regression of vote preference on income
nes5200_dt <- data.table(nes5200)
  yr <- 2000
nes5200_dt_s<-nes5200_dt[ year==yr,]
nes5200_dt_s$income <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$income)
nes5200_dt_s$partyid7 <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$partyid7)

nes5200_dt_s$gender <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$gender, labels=c("male", "female"))
nes5200_dt_s$race <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$race, labels=c("white", "black", "asian", 
                                    "native american", "hispanic"))
nes5200_dt_s$south <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$south)
nes5200_dt_s$ideo <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$ideo, labels=c("liberal", "moderate", "conservative"))

nes_data_comp<-nes5200_dt_s[complete.cases(nes5200_dt_s[,list(partyid7,income,ideo,female,white)])]
nes_data_comp$ideology <- scale(nes_data_comp$ideo_feel,center=TRUE)
```
1. Summarize the parameter estimates numerically and also graphically. 

```{r}
m1 <- polr(partyid3 ~ ideo + race + age_10, Hess=TRUE, data=nes_data_comp)
summary(m1)
```

2. Explain the results from the fitted model.
```{r}

confint(m1)

"ideo: moderates and conservatives are more likely to be republicans. In particular, 
a moderate has 1.07 increase in the expected value on the log odds scale, given all 
of the other variables in the model are held constant. Conservatives have a 2.37 
increase in the log odds scale.

race: whites, and asian are more likely to identify themselves as republicans. 

age_10: One unit increase in age, we expect a decrease 0.07 (-0.07) in the expect
value of partyid3 on the log odds scale, given all of the other variables in the model are held constant"

```

3. Use a binned residual plot to assess the fit of the model.
```{r}

a1<- nnet::multinom(partyid7 ~ ideology + dem_therm, data = nes_data_comp)
binnedplot(fitted(a1), resid(a1))


```




# High School and Beyond 
The hsb data was collected as a subset of the High School and Beyond study conducted by the National Education Longitudinal Studies program of the National Center for Education Statistics. The variables are gender; race; socioeconomic status; school type; chosen high school program type; scores on reading, writing, math, science, and social studies. We want to determine which factors are related to the choice of the type of program—academic, vocational, or general—that the students pursue in high school. The response is multinomial with three levels.

```{r}
data(hsb)
?hsb
```

1. Fit a trinomial response model with the other relevant variables as predictors (untransformed).
```{r}

require(nnet)
m2 <- multinom(prog ~ gender + race + ses + schtyp + read + write + math +science + socst, hsb, trace = FALSE)

summary(m2)

```

2. For the student with id 99, compute the predicted probabilities of the three possible choices.

```{r}
m3 <- step(m2, scope=~., direction="backward", trace = FALSE)
summary(m3)
library(tidyverse)
predict <- hsb %>% filter(id == 99)
predict$prog
predict(m2, newdata = predict, type = "probs")

```


# Happiness
Data were collected from 39 students in a University of Chicago MBA class and may be found in the dataset `happy`.
```{r}
library(faraway)
data(happy)
?happy

```

1. Build a model for the level of happiness as a function of the other variables.
```{r}
hap1 <- multinom(happy ~ money + sex+ love +work, data = happy)
summary(hap1)

```

2. Interpret the parameters of your chosen model.
```{r}
round(confint(hap1),2)

```

3. Predict the happiness distribution for subject whose parents earn $30,000 a year,
who is lonely, not sexually active and has no job.
```{r}
(p1 <- data.frame(money = 30, sex = 0, love = 1, work =1))
predict(hap1, newdata = p1, type = "probs" )
```

# newspaper survey on Vietnam War
A student newspaper conducted a survey of student opinions about the Vietnam War in May 1967. Responses were classified by sex, year in the program and one of four opinions. The survey was voluntary. The data may be found in the dataset `uncviet`.  Treat the opinion as the response and the sex and year as predictors. Build a proportional odds model, giving an interpretation to the estimates.

```{r}
data(uncviet)
?uncviet
m4 <- multinom(policy ~ sex + year, weights = y, data = uncviet)
summary(m4)

"for policy B, the yearGrad has a coefficient of 0.719 which shows that the grad students are more 
likely to choose policy B. The same method for the other type of students, males have a negative 
coefficient on the policy B,C,D. and Junior students are more likely to choose policy D compare to policy
B and C."
```

# pneumonoconiosis of coal miners
The pneumo data gives the number of coal miners classified by radiological examination into one of three categories of pneumonoconiosis and by the number of years spent working at the coal face divided into eight categories.

```{r}
library(faraway)
data(pneumo,package="faraway")
?pneumo
```

1. Treating the pneumonoconiosis status as response variable as nominal, build a model for predicting the frequency of the three outcomes in terms of length of service and use it to predict the outcome for a miner with 25 years of service.

```{r}
pne1 <- multinom(status ~ year,weights = Freq, data = pneumo)
summary(pne1)

#predict the miner with 25 years of service
p2 <- data.frame(year=25)
predict(pne1, newdata = p2, type = "probs")

```

2. Repeat the analysis with the pneumonoconiosis status being treated as ordinal. 

```{r}

pne2 <- polr(status ~ year, weights = Freq, data = pneumo)
summary(pne2)

#predict the miner with 25 years of service
p3 <- data.frame(year=25)
predict(pne2, newdata =p3, type = "probs")

```

3.Now treat the response variable as hierarchical with top level indicating whether
the miner has the disease and the second level indicating, given they have the
disease, whether they have a moderate or severe case. 

```{r}


```

4.  Compare the three analyses.

```{r}
#There is not a significant difference between nominal and ordinal model
```





# (optional) Multinomial choice models: 

Pardoe and Simonton (2006) fit a discrete choice model to predict winners of the Academy Awards. Their data are in the folder academy.awards.

1. Fit your own model to these data.

```{r}

model1 <-  select(oscar, -c("Comp","Name", "Movie"))
fit.model<- multinom(Ch ~. , data = model1)

model2 <- multinom(Ch ~ Year +  Gm1 + Gf1 +Gf2 +PGA +DGA+SAM , data = model1)

summary(model2)

```

2. Display the fitted model on a plot that also shows the data.

```{r}

```

3. Make a plot displaying the uncertainty in inferences from the fitted model.

```{r}
